# Communication protocols

As you may know, communication is the exchange of information between entities. 
Just like most of the things we have explored so far that are related to microcontrollers and embedded systems, communications are structured in organized layers, which enables us to diversify communications in a controlled manner. In electronics, this is defined in the protocol stack, one very popular example is the Open Systems Interconnection or OSI model.
Communication protocols, in the context of electronics, are sets of rules on how to communicate two or more electronic devices. Let's try to create a communication protocol that conveys information from one microcontroller to another. 

Where should we start?

Once we define this, we can see a working example, in this case, the UART/USART communication protocol
