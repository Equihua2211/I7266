\section{Introduction}
This guide is intended to show the process of installation of the tools required to develop software for the 8-bit AVR microcontrollers. The guide and the examples provided here are particularly, but not exclusively, oriented to the ATmega328P. This guide is meant to help, but not to solve all the problems that may arise during installation, thus, some changes might be needed to make everything work depending on your system and the devices you decide to use, but this info can be easily found on the internet. The documentation for the software and hardware mentioned in this document can be found at the end of it.

\section{Requirements}
This guide is made thinking of laptops running Windows 10 (and later). Minimum requirements have not been defined but almost any modern system (probably from 2015 and on) in good conditions should work just fine. For the hardware, the following is needed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A programmer supported by avrdude, in this case, the USBasp (see other supported devices).
    \item An 8-bit AVR microcontroller, in this case, the ATmega328P (see other supported devices).
    \item The circuitry needed for the microcontroller to work. For the ATmega328P: a breadboard, a \SI{16}{\mega\hertz} crystal oscillator, two \SI{22}{\pico\farad} capacitors, a pushbutton, a \SI{10}{\kilo\ohm} resistor and some wire for the breadboard.
\end{itemize}

\section{Software tools}
To set up a basic development environment, I would suggest having the following software tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A text editor, preferably, one intended for software development in C language.
    \item A compiler, and its related tools and libraries.
    \item A programmer.
\end{itemize}
My personal preference in a Windows machine is \textit{VS Code} for the text editor, and the tools that I would recommend are the \textit{AVR 8-bit GNU Toolchain} and \textit{AVRDUDE} as the programmer.

\subsection{VisualStudio Code}
Download it from \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/Download}{this link} and follow the installer instructions.

\subsection{AVR 8-bit Toolchain}
This toolchain can be obtained from the Microchip website in \href{https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio/gcc-compilers}{this link}. If you're in a Windows system, select \textbf{AVR 8-Bit Toolchain (Windows)} and after downloading, extract the folder and change its name to {\color{teal}avr8-gnu-toolchain}. Finally, move the folder to {\color{teal}C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash}.

\subsection{AVRDUDE}
This programmer can be downloaded from \href{https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/releases}{this link}. In a similar fashion, after downloading and extracting the folder, rename the folder to {\color{teal}avrdude}, and move the folder to {\color{teal}C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash}.

\subsection{Zadig}
This program installs the required driver for the USBasp programmer, if you’re not using this programmer, you may omit this installation, but you might need to check if you have to install any other drivers. In my setup, this is mandatory, so download it from its website following \href{https://zadig.akeo.ie/}{this link}. After downloading, connect your USBasp, and only then, execute the downloaded application. A window like in figure \ref{img:3} should open, and if the dropdown menu has selected \textbf{USBasp}, you may proceed installing the \textbf{WinUSB} driver by clicking \textbf{Install WCID}.

\section{Environment Variables}
To be able to use the compiler and programmer you just installed, you need to update you Environment Variables in the following manner:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Click the Windows menu (or press the Windows key in your keyboard) and type textit{variables}.
    \item One of the results should be \textit{Edit the system environment variables}, click it.
    \item In the new window, titled \textit{System Properties}, click the button \textit{Environment Variables}, almost at the bottom of the window.
    \item In the next window, you should see two fields, one for \textit{User variables for ...} and \textit{System variables}. Under \textit{User variables for ...}, look for the variable called \textbf{Path}, select it and click \textit{Edit...}. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If you don't have a \textbf{Path} variable, click \textit{New...} 
        \item In the \textit{New User Variable} window, under \textit{Variable name}, write \textbf{Path}
        \item Under \textit{Variable value}, write {\color{teal}C:\textbackslash Program Files\textbackslash avr8-gnu-toolchain\textbackslash bin}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
